# Ensemble-Learning-Methods
Ensemble Learning -
Ensemble Learning is a process using which multiple machine learning models (such as classifiers) are strategically constructed to solve a particular problem.


Different techniques used in ensemble learning methods

#Simple Ensemble learning
1.Max Voting -
In this technique, multiple models are used to make predictions for each data point. The predictions by each model are considered as a 'vote'. The predictions which we get from the majority of the models are used as the final prediction.

2.Averaging -
Take an average of predictions from all the models and use it to make the final prediction.

3.Weighted Averaging -
This is an extension of the averaging method. All models are assigned different weights defining the importance of each model for prediction.
